section1Summary = "<p><strong>What distinguishes Search It Recruitment from other recruitment agencies?</strong></p>

<p>Just like most agencies we have years of experience in the field of employment, an interesting network, knowledge of our target market and the technologies they work with. We speak the language of our candidates and we are aware of our client’s business. Like most agencies we take the time to do an extensive intake with our candidates. We have a portfolio with challenging vacancies and in the past years we have proven that we are able to match candidates with clients.</p>

<p><strong>So what makes us so unique?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Search It Recruitment only works for companies we’d like to work ourselves.</li>
	<li>We never share cv’s from candidates without notifying.</li>
	<li>We have an intensive coaching program to guide your candidates in the first few months after starting to work for one of your clients.</li>
	<li>We help skilled migrants with their applications and relocation.</li>
	<li>All members of the Search It Recruitment family have passion for their profession.</li>
	<li>We’re not on the “online Blacklist of Recruiters”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are you ready for a new challenge in your career and looking for a loyal and honest recruitment agency? Could you use some help in finding a challenging job at a company that fits you? Don’t hesitate and upload your cv or contact us.</p>
